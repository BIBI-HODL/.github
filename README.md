# BIBI HODL

BIBI HODL is organized by BIBI volunteers. We are committed to creating an ecosystem full of WEB3 characteristics, focusing on cutting-edge technology development, BSC ecosystem collaboration, and community building around $BIBI Token.
By bringing together technical talents, artists, and KOLs, we will fully leverage the power of the community to continuously launch DAPPs representing the forefront of social technology, empowering the BIBI ecosystem and promoting BIBI culture.
All income from BIBI HODL will enter the treasury, with 70% allocated for community building and rewards, and 30% for burning to ensure continuous deflation. We believe this is not just a social experiment, but a way to discover the real difference between social practice and social experimentation through the implementation of technology and cultural dissemination.
Let's explore the WEB3-infused BIBI HODL community together and create a better future.
