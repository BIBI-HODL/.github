## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to **BIBI HODL**, a decentralized autonomous community organized by BIBI volunteers. Our community is dedicated to building a thriving ecosystem around BIBI Token through cutting-edge technology, BSC ecosystem collaboration, and community development.
We believe in the power of collaboration and are committed to bringing together volunteers with diverse backgrounds and skill sets, including technical experts, artists, and social scientists. Together, we will continue to launch innovative DAPPs and NFT artworks that represent the forefront of social technology, all with the goal of empowering the BIBI ecosystem and promoting BIBI culture.

All of our income goes into the BIBI HODL treasury, with 70% used for community development and rewards, and 30% for continuous deflation through token burning.
We see BIBI HODL as more than just a social experiment. Through the application of technology and cultural dissemination, we aim to bridge the gap between social practice and social experimentation.

If you're interested in getting involved, we welcome contributions from anyone who shares our vision. Check out our contribution guidelines and useful resources to learn more about how you can join our community and help us build a better future for BIBI.
